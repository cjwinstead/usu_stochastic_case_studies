Compute steady-state probabilities:

S=? [condition]

Here the condition could be something like "Q=1" meaning calculate the
long-run probability that signal "Q" is 1.

Compute transient probabilities:

P=? [condition]

Here the condition can be something like "Q=1" or a more complex formula like
"F[Tstep,Tstep] Q=1" meaning calculate the probability at time Tstep that Q=1.
