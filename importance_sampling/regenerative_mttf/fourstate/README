This directory contains a MATLAB demonstration for estimating the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)
of a four-state reliability model. The main simulation script is "fourstateexample.m", and
the other two scripts handle figure drawing.

In the top lines of "fourstateexample.m", some options can be customized. The simulation can 
be run using the embedded DTMC model by setting "DTMC=true", or the CTMC model can be used
by setting "DTMC=false". The fail and repair rates can also be adjusted, as can the number of
paths to simulate.
